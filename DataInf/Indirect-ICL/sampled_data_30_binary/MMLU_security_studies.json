{"input": "Q: In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework provide an analytical framework for practitioners' success?\nOptions:\n(B)The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.\n(C)The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.", "target": "(B)"}

{"input": "Q: Is TNC a new phenomenon?\nOptions:\n(A)There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\n(B)Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: To what extent can societal identity be defended militarily?\nOptions:\n(A)If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures.\n(D)Societal groups do not face military threats; being constituted by identity and social cohesion, military forces are not engaged against societal groups in any meaningful way.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: To what extent is TNC linked with terrorism, and in what ways?\nOptions:\n(B)The nexus between terrorist groups and criminal organizations are generally a temporary aberration. Differential long-term strategic goals meant that levels of cooperation were generally tactical temporary alliances that would have little pervasive effects.\n(C)There is increasing evidence over the convergence of terrorism and transnational crime, but there is no consensus about whether this phenomenon is a long-term strategic alliance or episodic \"marriages of convenience\".", "target": "(C)"}

{"input": "Q: Describe the relationship between the military security domain and social constructivism.\nOptions:\n(A)It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.\n(B)Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: What is the 'security dilemma' that faces weak states?\nOptions:\n(A)The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\n(C)The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: What potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction emerged?\nOptions:\n(C)Security studies has been marked by the gradual \"IR-ification\" of the discipline. Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D)Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated. The institutional blurring between universities, think tank, and policy has resulted in policy mergers at every level.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: What are the practical problems associated with applying coercive diplomacy in the West?\nOptions:\n(A)Different natures of the adversaries complicate the use of Western coercion. Their tendency to rely on irregular or asymmetric military strategies makes it hard to threaten or even defeat their opponent's military strategy. Those actors deny forces the ability to win quickly with little cost.\n(C)Coalitional coercive diplomacy is the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary. However, past efforts of coalitional building have proved to be extremely limited. Disagreements over the means and coordination of the policy often result in splits and consequently states are reluctant to employ it. Where it has been employed it collapses under the weight of its own inadequacy.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: What problems has the post-Cold War security literature revealed on women, war, development, and security?\nOptions:\n(A)Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues.\n", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: How can we define the role of the state in achieving human security?\nOptions:\n(B)The state has the greatest material resources and power with which to secure the human referent object.\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following statements best describes the characteristics of a weak state?\nOptions:\n(A)The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.\n(D)Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: Can armed forces be linked to environmental security and in what ways?\nOptions:\n(B)It is when considering the military and the security institutions that some of the greatest contradictions with the concept of environmental security are raised. War impacts negatively on the sustainable growth of the nation but armed forces may be required to manage the effects.\n(C)Stronger militaries and technological advances have reduced the negative impact on the environment having greater impact with fewer materials, whilst the spectre of mass destruction warfare has been reduced with the ending of the Cold War.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: Considering Wendt's three cultures of anarchy; which of the following defines the Lockean culture?\nOptions:\n(B)A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.\n(D)A culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas abound, and security is a zero-sum game.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: What is the future of WMD?\nOptions:\n(B)The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n(D)WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: What factors facilitated the institutional innovation of security studies?\nOptions:\n(C)Broader political considerations about the potential implications of long-term mobilization resulted in a shift from tactical operations to long-term strategy.\n(D)The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Are strategies of Arms Control and Deterrence useful in cyber-security?\nOptions:\n(B)Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.\n(C)Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.", "target": "(C)"}

{"input": "Q: In what ways may TNC be regarded as a new concept?\nOptions:\n(A)Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.\n(B)Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: How are US 'military moms' important to a critical reading of security?\nOptions:\n(C)All of these.\n(D)Mothers are indispensable to the exercise of military power but often overlooked in traditional security analyses.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways has the concept of environmental security been contested?\nOptions:\n(A)Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\n(D)The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: Why do so many feminist scholars regard the exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat as important?\nOptions:\n(B)Participation in military activity is often regarded as a sign of strength, patriotism and courage.\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: Which of the following is not one of the unifying principles of Critical Security Studies, as defined by Krause?\nOptions:\n(A)Principle actors are social constructs that are made through political practices.\n(B)Natural-science methodology is the best way to study social science, interpretive methodologies lack the coherence required for in-depth analysis.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus?\nOptions:\n(C)Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.\n(D)Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways is defining coercive diplomacy success problematic?\nOptions:\n(B)Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\n(D)Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: What are Fission Nuclear Weapons?\nOptions:\n(A)Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion.\n(D)Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Traditional approaches seek to explain why and how states have sought security. Which answer best describes the approach of traditional Security Studies?\nOptions:\n(B)The traditional approaches emerged in response to the Cold War, and to the accumulation of tension and competition between the two Superpowers. Traditional theories seek to explain behaviour in terms of arms accumulation.\n(D)Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of these is an effective way of securing against cyber threats?\nOptions:\n(D)Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience.\n", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: How has coercive diplomacy featured in contemporary security studies?\nOptions:\n(A)Compellence and coercion through diplomacy are linked with the 'pre-emptive use of force'.\n", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways can a distinction be made between limited force and full-scale force?\nOptions:\n(B)Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.\n(D)The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: In defining the term 'historical materialism', which of the following statements best defines the term 'materialism'?\nOptions:\n(A)Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change.\n(D)In their rejection of class orientated political interaction, HM scholars refer to wealth instead as the accumulation or access to physical resources, coining the term materialism to describe this approach.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: What is meant by the term 'energy security nexus'?\nOptions:\n(C)An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another.\n", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: What is the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention?\nOptions:\n(D)The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security.

{"input": "Q: In what ways is it possible to gain a definition of terrorism?\nOptions:\n(B)Organization is essential for a successful campaign to bring about the political goals that are being sought. An act of terrorism targets an audience that extends beyond the immediate victims and is characterized as being a weapon of the weak.\n(D)Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives. The definition may therefore be inclusive of governments as targets or perpetrators and cases of war (hot and cold) where terror and counter-terror measures are tactics of either side.", "target": "(B)"}

Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\n(D)Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict.

In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Given current patterns of industrial development, what are the future prospects for energy security?\nOptions:\n(C)Whilst forecasts predict that energy consumption in the industrialised states of the North will continue to increase, the major increase in demand will come from the developing states of the South, posing major challenges to global energy security.\n(D)Although demand from developing states is set to increase the global consumption of dwindling energy resources, technological advancements in alternative energy sources, coupled with comprehensive understanding of current resource levels and access, will secure energy supply in the foreseeable future.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: What are the themes that make post-structuralism a different field of study and why is it criticized?\nOptions:\n(A)One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.\n(C)A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.", "target": "(A)"}

Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players.\n(D)The defence trade refers solely to the trade in weapons and small arms that takes place outside the legal interactions between states.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of these statements is commonly regarded as a tangible benefit of the securitization process?\nOptions:\n(A)Securitizing injects urgency into an issue and leads to a sustained mobilization of political support and deployment of resources.\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of these statements defines the Copenhagen School's view of security?\nOptions:\n(A)Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.\n", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: How might weapons belonging to state military or police forces arrive on the illicit arms market?\nOptions:\n(C)Illegal trading by states is the primary way in which weapons purchased legally might end up on the illegal arms market.\n(D)Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?\nOptions:\n(B)The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.\n(C)The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Which statement best describes the circumstances that have shaped the emergence of peace studies as a field of research?\nOptions:\n(A)Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.\n", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following best describes the existing legacy of structural adjustment policies?\nOptions:\n(B)The neoliberal principles on which structural adjustment policies have been based have proven well suited to promoting human welfare in developing countries.\n(C)Neoliberal based adjustment policies have caused great and unnecessary hardship in developing countries and there is still no evidence they achieved their objectives for macroeconomic stability and growth.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\nOptions:\n(A)The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B)Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: What factors enabled the expansion of transnational crime (TNC) in the 1990s?\nOptions:\n(C)Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.\n(D)International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following best describes what is meant by security in the contemporary world, according to the field of Security Studies?\nOptions:\n(C)'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\n(D)None of the above", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following statements best describes the orientation of military security within the traditional conception of security studies?\nOptions:\n(A)Strategic studies are the central concern of international relations, within strategic studies, the subset of security studies focuses on military security.\n(D)Military security is the central concern of strategic studies; and strategic studies are a subset of security studies. Military security is one of the central concerns of security studies, and security studies is a subset of international relations.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: During the 20th century, how has the focus of security studies changed regarding military security?\nOptions:\n(B)Military security has emerged since the Cold War as the dominant sector within security analysis; both scholars and practitioners recognise the paramount importance of pursuing military security, based on the idea that military capabilities pose the greatest threat to human and state survival.\n(D)During the Cold War most security analysts agreed that military security should be the focus of security studies; as a result, there was not much discussion about what security entailed, other than the military sector. Following this period security studies have been broadened to include the wider range of sectors that we see today, including environmental and political security.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: What are the types of terrorism? Are all groups the same?\nOptions:\n(A)Religious terrorism seems to be one of the hallmarks of the post-Cold War age. Religious terrorism is understood to denote the extremist activities of Islamic fundamentalism. Al-Qaeda is the most prominent example of religious terrorist groups and is described as globally operational, although religious terrorism is not limited to the al-Qaeda network. Christian beliefs were used to justify the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, as well as anti-abortionist assassinations in the USA.\n(D)All of the above are correct.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: What preventative security measures might a government take in defence of a potential future terrorist attack?\nOptions:\n(A)Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).\n", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: Which approach or perspective dominates post-Cold War Security Studies?\nOptions:\n(A)An examination of the social processes by which groups of people construct something as a threat.\n(C)The re-addressing of past practice as a possible cause of insecurity.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\nOptions:\n(B)Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C)The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following defines a Revolution in Military Affairs?\nOptions:\n(D)A watershed in technological advancement which alters the fundamental characteristics of war.\n", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: What internal security policy options are available to elites?\nOptions:\n(B)Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime requiring the deliberate undermining of armed forces.\n", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, in what ways does the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differ from that of Critical Security Studies?\nOptions:\n(A)The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\n(C)Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: How might the recent global economic crisis be viewed as a challenge to the liberalist perspective?\nOptions:\n(A)Governmental cyberspace restrictions, in the form of censorship and monitoring, are increasing.\n(D)Increasing state involvement in key industrial and financial sectors, including nationalisation and state-funded development.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: How has HM developed during and since the Cold War?\nOptions:\n(C)The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has lead to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.\n", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: What is the relationship between historical materialism and the global justice movement?\nOptions:\n(C)Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\n(D)Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?\nOptions:\n(A)There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.\n(C)Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways will the changing global security environment shape the nature of developing conflicts in the twenty-first century?\nOptions:\n(A)Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict.\n", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: When may an issue fail to become securitized?\nOptions:\n(B)When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented.\n(C)When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measure.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: How has the conceptualization of health as a security issue changed during the twentieth century?\nOptions:\n(C)Pandemic disease is a relatively new threat to security, emerging only in the early 19th century. Therefore, human populations are still formulating and testing new ways of controlling outbreaks and minimising their impact on security.\n(D)During the 20th century, security analysts were predisposed to focus on the potential threat of nuclear confrontation and military combat. Since the reduction in these threats, there has emerged a series of pandemic diseases, and a sense of growing unease at the future impact of more serious outbreaks in an increasingly globalised population.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: In what ways did game theory and deterrence theory mark an intellectual development in the 'golden age' of security studies?\nOptions:\n(B)The progressive research programs produced theories that actually formed their own reality of abstractions, the world of, 'secure second strike capability', 'extended deterrence' and 'escalation dominance'.\n", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways may weak states be challenged externally?\nOptions:\n(B)Weak states are threatened by the proliferation of small arms which can be used in a challenge to the authority of the state. Small and light weapons are purchasable through legal and illegal channels and are prevalent in regions with warlords, criminals and private militias.\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following might be considered part of the 'deepening and broadening' of security?\nOptions:\n(C)Environmental changes.\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways does gender shape the conceptualization of nationhood and conflict?\nOptions:\n(A)Although often missing from the traditional literature on war and security, women frequently serve the purposes of nationalise causes, with nationalism often presented in highly gendered and female terms, where women are symbols of statehood.\n(D)When thinking about national identity, violence, physical strength, aggression, and the ability to use force are attributed as feminine characteristics. The male identity is imagined as being one of domesticity, nurturing, care, and child rearing.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways does the idea of 'victim' impact on the way in which gender security is regarded?\nOptions:\n(A)Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery).\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: Considering commerce and marketing, which of the following present the most significant obstacle to developing IT security?\nOptions:\n(B)Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.\n(D)All of these options.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: How have the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as international financial institutions (IFIs), affected the development of poorer countries?\nOptions:\n(D)IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems. Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.\n", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: To what extent and to what effect has the environment been securitized?\nOptions:\n(C)The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security.\n(D)The national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security. The militarization of environmental problems has decreased the ability of policymakers to 'capture' the critical nature of environmental problems and the environmental dimensions to social vulnerability. The reconciliation of environmental security with national security, and global levels of international change cannot be made without trading in the security interests of the state.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Has TNC become a national security threat?\nOptions:\n(C)The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries.\n(D)All of the above are correct.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following is not a response to the illicit arms trade?\nOptions:\n(C)2001 UN Security Council Resolution 1308 on HIV/AIDS as a National Security Threat.\n(D)2005 Marking and Tracing of Weapons Accord.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: How does Buzan's concept of 'societal security' mark a departure from traditional understandings of security?\nOptions:\n(B)The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\n(D)Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of the following policies is not true of economic policy?\nOptions:\n(B)Policymakers can incentivize security-promoting behaviours in others through the use of sanctions and aid.\n(D)Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Why is coercive diplomacy hard? What are the inherent difficulties?\nOptions:\n(B)Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.\n(C)The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: How can we define energy security?\nOptions:\n(B)Energy security refers to the ability of the current energy supplies to meet the demands of state military consumption, placing the military at the core of the security paradigm.\n(C)To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: Which statement best describes Booth's attitude toward constructivism and post-structuralism within Critical Security Studies?\nOptions:\n(A)Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.\n(B)Constructivism offers a number of specific political theories applicable to Critical Security Studies but all of these lack the tenability required in security studies. Post-structuralist theories similarly lack the durability desired by CSS scholars.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: What role does the concept of 'human security' have in our understanding of security studies?\nOptions:\n(C)The concept of human security does not challenge traditional state-centric arguments in so far as these concern the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does show that state-centric realism is insufficient because it does not address the security of people within states.\n", "target": "(C)"}

{"input": "Q: In what ways is a fusion nuclear device different from a fission device?\nOptions:\n(A)A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential.\n(D)Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect. The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated. Bombs even within the multi-megaton range have unlimited military utility, their destructive capability can be manufactured according to the target.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: How can the origins of weak state insecurity be explained?\nOptions:\n(C)The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\n", "target": "(C)"}

{"input": "Q: According to Krause and Williams, what agenda would most likely attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies?\nOptions:\n(A)To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied.\n(D)To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: How might we understand the terms gender and gender security?\nOptions:\n(D)The study of gender and of gender security issues is a complex task, and both terms elude a uniform definition. The concept of gender security broadens terms of security beyond the military sector to also include 'human security'.\n", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: In what way might postcolonial analysis use the term 'thick space'?\nOptions:\n(A)To describe the international as hierarchically ordered and comprised of a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations.\n(C)To describe countries that are oppressed or marginalised within imperial readings of IR.", "target": "(A)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of these statements characterizes the traditional concept of national security, as opposed to human security?\nOptions:\n(B)In the national security approach, real threats are only those posed to human life, human rights, or human dignity.\n(D)The concept of national security is too narrow to be useful when analysing the broad threats that currently exist.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: What long-term trends can be foreseen in the concept of environmental security?\nOptions:\n(C)National security practices are the most effective means to achieving environmental security reforms to consolidate the socio-economic organizational base of the country against threat. The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.\n(D)The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways might international measures be employed? Are they a help or a hindrance?\nOptions:\n(B)A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents.\n(D)Multi-partner initiatives to support the reforms necessary for the prevention of terrorism have proved ineffective. Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: What role does language play in the process of securitization?\nOptions:\n(B)The speech act is the end point of the two-stage process of securitization, at this point the legitimacy of the existential threat is established and the right to employ special measures in addressing the threat is granted to the securitizing actor.\n(D)The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act. This speech act is presented to an audience by a securitizing actor. This actor attempts to convince that audience of the credibility of the issue as an existential threat to a specific referent object. If successful, the audience is convinced and the securitizing actor is granted recourse to legitimately use extraordinary measures in response to the threat.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: How do biological differences affect the roles that men and women must perform for the state?\nOptions:\n(B)The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.\n(D)Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: What is the relationship between culture and social constructivism?\nOptions:\n(B)Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed.\n(D)Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: How might the period of academic institutionalization be assessed?\nOptions:\n(A)The distinct phenomenon of strategic studies emerged as an imported American specialty.

{"input": "Q: Prior to the late 20th century the role of women in war had been neglected as an area of concern in security studies, for what reason?\nOptions:\n(B)The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\n(D)Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.", "target": "(B)"}

{"input": "Q: To what extent have biological agents been weaponized?\nOptions:\n(C)Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population.\n", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework explain previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions?\nOptions:\n(C)Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.\n(D)All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.", "target": "(D)"}
{"input": "Q: Which of these statements is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century?\nOptions:\n(A)Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping.\n(C)By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.", "target": "(C)"}
{"input": "Q: What might the pragmatic implications of biology be on post-conflict gender security?\nOptions:\n(A)Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations.\n", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: In what ways do theories of conventional and critical social constructivism differ?\nOptions:\n(A)Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other. Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology.\n(C)Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology. Critical constructivists challenge these theories, embracing positivist methodologies in their work.", "target": "(A)"}

{"input": "Q: In what ways might the effects of chemical weapons affect the decision to deploy them against a target?\nOptions:\n(B)Analysts are concerned with the potential ease of chemical manufacturing. Weapons could be quickly and effectively deployed being light, concealable and rapidly deployed. Most weapons can be delivered in a line source for example a crop duster or administered through an aerosol. Dispersal in areas of poor ventilation or closed venues where people are in close proximity could have potentially catastrophic effects.\n(D)Wind, temperature and terrain can affect the lethality and persistence of an agent and is dependent on the extensity and degree of contact with the target.", "target": "(D)"}

{"input": "Q: Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?\nOptions:\n(B)The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.\n(D)Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: Threats to IT systems can be classified in many ways; in this chapter three different categories of threat are listed. According to this classification, which of the following would be classified as a 'Failure'?\nOptions:\n(B)There is a programming error in the software which causes the system to perform badly.\n(D)The IT system has failed due to a random unexpected event, such as a tsunami which destroys key electronic equipment.", "target": "(B)"}
{"input": "Q: What would be the policy implications of a hierarchical vision of TNC?\nOptions:\n(D)Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership.

{"input": "Q: How does the social constructivist approach account for the process of militarization?\nOptions:\n(A)By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways.\n(B)Social constructivists tend to focus on the population rather than military as an area for study, thus regarding the process of militarization largely in terms of its impact on human security.", "target": "(A)"}
