{"idx": 67, "cot": "Q: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\n(A) By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum (B) By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell (C) By changing the shape of the protein (D) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity.\nOptions:\n(A) By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum \n(C) By changing the shape of the protein \n\nA: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. \n\nSo the answer is (C).", "source": "MMLU_high_school_biology", "pos": 1}

Choice A is incorrect because every even-numbered term in the pattern is odd, and 10 is an even number. Choice B is correct, because adding an odd number (in this case 11) to an odd number produces an even number, and adding an odd number to an even number produces an odd number. Thus the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, so there will never be two even numbers next to each other. Choice C is incorrect because the last term in the example is even (54), and we know that the terms will alternate between even and odd.
